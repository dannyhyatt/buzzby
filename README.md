# Buzzby

An app similar to YikYak made in 2023 with Flutter & Supabase.

## Features

- Posting with location attached
- Posts have distances listed
- Comments with nested replies
- Randomly generated usernames, and a theme color based on the hash of the
  username
- Signing up with a `.edu` email will have an icon from users who attend the
  same school

## API Keys

- This project is running on a free Supabase instance so I have committed the
  API keys
- I have not committed the OneSignal API keys

Please note Buzzby is designed for smartphone screens and I just used Material
instead of implementing my own design. If you want to see some of my
well-designed apps, please look at
